# This is **A Way Home**

## About

This is an app which displays the shortest route for any given path.
It utilizes dijkstra's algorithm to go from the start node to the end node and it is capable of bypassing obstacles. It takes in user input for both the start and end nodes and creates a vizual display of the search algorithm. Users can create walls to test the algorithm's efficiency and see alternative paths.
